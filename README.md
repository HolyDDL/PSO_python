# PSO

A particle swarm optimization algorithm with Python.

## How to use it

- Write your object function without condition of constraint (Can use penalty function deal with constraints)
- The object function should to be minimized
- import pso
- use `pso.PSO(3, objfun, x0s, v0s, vmax, ...)` to optimize object function.
